# form-translation-ui
A UI for dynamically adding translations to forms

Interactive Builder for Form Translations within the Form Builder
🚀 Welcome to the Interactive Form Translation Builder!

This project aims to create a dynamic, user-friendly UI that allows users to easily add translations for forms in different languages, eliminating the need for manually editing JSON files in configuration folders.

🔗 GitHub Repository: form-translation-ui

📌 Why This Project?
Currently, adding translations to forms requires modifying JSON files in a configuration folder, which:

Requires developer assistance to locate and update the correct files.

Has a JSON format different from the form structure, making it unintuitive for non-technical users.

Lacks a simple, interactive way to manage translations dynamically.

💡 This project aims to streamline the translation process by building a UI that enables users to:
✅ Add, edit, and manage translations directly within the form builder.
✅ Support multiple languages dynamically.
✅ Provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for non-technical users.
